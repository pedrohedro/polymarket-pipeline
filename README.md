# Polymarket Pipeline V2

An AI-powered breaking news detector that classifies events against prediction markets and trades automatically when it finds edge.

```
Breaking News (Twitter / Telegram / RSS)
        ↓ (< 5 seconds)
Match to niche markets (< $500K volume)
        ↓
AI Classification: bullish / bearish / neutral + materiality
        ↓
Edge detection + quarter-Kelly sizing
        ↓
Instant execution → SQLite log → calibration tracking
```

## What Changed From V1

V1 scraped RSS feeds (5-60 min delay), asked an LLM "what's the probability?" (wrong question for LLMs), and competed on high-volume markets (where every bot already operates).

V2 inverts all three:
- **Speed**: Real-time Twitter/Telegram streams instead of stale RSS
- **Classification**: Your configured AI provider classifies "bullish or bearish?" instead of estimating probability — a task LLMs are actually good at
- **Niche markets**: Only trades markets under $500K volume where the crowd is small and slow

## Setup (2 minutes)

### One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brodyautomates/polymarket-pipeline.git
cd polymarket-pipeline
bash setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brodyautomates/polymarket-pipeline.git
cd polymarket-pipeline
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your keys to `.env`:

```
AI_PROVIDER=codex                   # codex, openai, openrouter, anthropic, generic
AI_MODEL=                           # optional for Codex, required for API providers
AI_API_KEY=                         # generic/OpenAI-compatible key if needed
AI_BASE_URL=                        # generic/OpenAI-compatible base URL if needed
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=...             # Optional — real-time news stream
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...               # Optional — channel monitoring
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=...               # Optional — live trading only
```

For Codex OAuth, run `codex login` once and keep `AI_PROVIDER=codex`.
For OpenRouter, set `AI_PROVIDER=openrouter`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `AI_MODEL`.
For OpenAI-compatible APIs, set `AI_PROVIDER=generic`, `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, and `AI_MODEL`.

Provider examples:

```dotenv
# Codex OAuth
AI_PROVIDER=codex
CODEX_MODEL=

# OpenRouter
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4.1-mini
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...

# OpenAI API
AI_PROVIDER=openai
AI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Anthropic API
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
AI_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-latest
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
AI_PROVIDER=generic
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
AI_MODEL=llama3.1
AI_API_KEY=
```

### Verify

```bash
python cli.py verify
```

Use `python cli.py verify --ai-call` when you also want to spend one tiny model call to validate the selected provider end to end.

## How to Use

### V2: Event-Driven Pipeline (Recommended)

```bash
# Start the real-time pipeline — monitors news streams, classifies, trades
python cli.py watch

# Enable live trading
python cli.py watch --live
```

The `watch` command runs indefinitely. It connects to your configured news sources (Twitter, Telegram, RSS fallback), matches breaking headlines to niche Polymarket markets, classifies each with your selected AI provider, and executes trades when it finds edge.

### V1: Synchronous Pipeline

```bash
# Single scan — scrape RSS, score markets, log signals
python cli.py run

python cli.py run --max 15 --hours 12
```

### Live Dashboard

```bash
python cli.py dashboard
```

### Backtest

```bash
# Validate the V2 strategy against resolved markets
python cli.py backtest

python cli.py backtest --limit 50 --category ai
```

### All Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python cli.py watch` | V2: Real-time event-driven pipeline |
| `python cli.py run` | V1: Synchronous RSS-based pipeline |
| `python cli.py dashboard` | Live terminal dashboard |
| `python cli.py backtest` | Backtest against resolved markets |
| `python cli.py calibrate` | Classification accuracy report |
| `python cli.py niche` | Browse niche markets (volume-filtered) |
| `python cli.py verify` | Check all API keys and connections |
| `python cli.py scrape` | Test news scraper |
| `python cli.py markets` | Browse all active markets |
| `python cli.py trades` | View trade log |
| `python cli.py stats` | Performance + latency + calibration stats |

## Architecture

### V2 Pipeline (Event-Driven)

```
news_stream.py      Real-time news — Twitter API v2, Telegram, RSS fallback
market_watcher.py   Polymarket WebSocket — live prices, niche filter, momentum
ai_provider.py      Provider abstraction — Codex OAuth, OpenAI-compatible APIs, OpenRouter, Anthropic
classifier.py       AI classification — bullish/bearish/neutral + materiality
matcher.py          Routes breaking news to relevant markets
edge.py             Edge detection + Kelly sizing (V2: classification-based)
executor.py         Trade execution — dry-run + live CLOB orders (async)
pipeline.py         Event-driven orchestrator (asyncio)
calibrator.py       Tracks classification accuracy over time
backtest.py         Historical replay for strategy validation
```

### Shared Infrastructure

```
logger.py           SQLite — trades, news events, calibration, latency tracking
config.py           All settings, API keys, thresholds
dashboard.py        Bloomberg Terminal-style live dashboard
cli.py              CLI — watch, run, backtest, calibrate, niche, verify, etc.
```

## How It Actually Works

### 1. News Detection
Real-time streams from Twitter (filtered by keywords: OpenAI, Bitcoin, Fed rate, etc.), Telegram channels, and RSS fallback. Events are deduplicated and timestamped with receive latency.

### 2. Market Matching
Each headline is matched to active niche markets (<$500K volume) by keyword overlap. Only relevant markets proceed to classification.

### 3. Classification (The Key Shift)
Instead of "what's the probability?", the configured AI provider is asked: *"Does this news make the market MORE likely to resolve YES, MORE likely to resolve NO, or is it NOT RELEVANT?"*

This is a classification task — something LLMs are genuinely good at. The provider also rates materiality (0-1): how much should this move the price?

### 4. Edge Detection
If direction is bullish/bearish AND materiality exceeds threshold (default 0.6) AND the market price has room to move — that's a signal. Position sizing uses quarter-Kelly.

### 5. Execution
Dry-run by default. Live mode places orders via Polymarket CLOB API. Safety: $25 max bet, $100 daily limit.

### 6. Calibration
Every trade is tracked. As markets resolve, the system measures whether its classifications were correct. Accuracy by source and category informs future confidence.

## Safety

- Dry-run mode ON by default
- $25 max single bet, $100 daily limit
- Quarter-Kelly position sizing
- Niche market filter prevents competing against sophisticated bots
- Calibration tracking — auto-detects if strategy accuracy drops
- All API keys in `.env`, never committed
