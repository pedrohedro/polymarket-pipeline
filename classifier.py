## Market Question
{question}

## Current Market Price
YES: {yes_price:.2f} (implied probability: {yes_price:.0%})

## Breaking News
{headline}
Source: {source}

## Task
Does this news make the market question MORE likely to resolve YES, MORE likely to resolve NO, or is it NOT RELEVANT?

Also rate the MATERIALITY — how much should this move the price? 0.0 means no impact, 1.0 means this is definitive evidence.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:

  "materiality": <float 0.0 to 1.0>,
